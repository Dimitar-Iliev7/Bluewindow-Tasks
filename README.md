# Bluewindow-Tasks

I create a star rating component in React using Vite. You can use this in an application where you'd like to give users the ability to rate something on a scale from 1-5, or whatever scale you'd like. And the rating number is going to be displayed on the screen. I saw the rating component in the tasks you gave me. I decided to make a custum React component separately from the other tasks. My task is to show you my skills. I dont want to combine technologies in every separate project. That's why i show you the tasks piece by piece. 

# How does Vite work?
At its core, Vite does 2 things:

1. Serve your code locally during development.
2. Bundle your Javascript, CSS and other assets together for production.

There are other tools(bundlers) that do the same thing, such as webpack, Parcel and Rollup, so what makes Vite different?

# Why I am choosing Vite over CRA

For almost one years, I used CRA for my React applications and I was happy because there were no configuration files and the build times were not a big deal for me because I was working on simple projects that contains а few lines of code. However, when I tried to build something massive, like 10,000 lines of code, I started to get tired of waiting because when I started my project, the development server was getting ready in almost 5 minutes, and whenever I made a change in my code, I had to wait for almost 5 to 10 seconds to see the effects. These times are pretty huge when you are working a real-life project. I knew that it was not about my computer but CRA. That’s when I searched for some alternatives for CRA and found Vite.

# In the star-rating project 
I'm using custom React components and { useState } to show my skills with React states.
