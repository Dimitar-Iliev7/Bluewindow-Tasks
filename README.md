# Bluewindow-Tasks

I create a star rating component in React using Vite. You can use this in an application where you'd like to give users the ability to rate something on a scale from 1-5, or whatever scale you'd like. And the rating number is going to be displayed on the screen.

# How does Vite work?
At its core, Vite does 2 things:

1. Serve your code locally during development.
2. Bundle your Javascript, CSS and other assets together for production.

There are other tools(bundlers) that do the same thing, such as webpack, Parcel and Rollup, so what makes Vite different?

# In the star-rating project 
I'm using custom React components and { useState } to show my skills with React states.
